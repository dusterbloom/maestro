# Pipeline Reliability Strategy

## Overview
This document outlines a comprehensive strategy to prevent pipeline breaks and ensure system reliability based on issues encountered during development.

## Immediate Actions (High Impact)

### 1. Enhanced Startup Validation
Create `scripts/validate-environment.sh`:
- Check all required environment variables exist
- Validate service URLs are reachable  
- Verify Docker containers can communicate
- Test Ollama model availability
- Validate WhisperLive WebSocket connectivity

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# Example validation checks:
curl -f http://localhost:11434/api/tags || exit 1
curl -f ws://localhost:9090 || exit 1
test -n "$NEXT_PUBLIC_ORCHESTRATOR_WS_URL" || exit 1
```

### 2. Comprehensive Health Checks
Enhanced `/health` endpoints that check:
- Service internal state
- External dependencies (WhisperLive, Ollama, TTS)
- Configuration validity
- Memory/disk usage
- WebSocket connectivity status

```python
# Example health check structure:
{
  "status": "healthy",
  "dependencies": {
    "whisper_live": "connected",
    "ollama": "available", 
    "tts": "ready"
  },
  "config": "valid",
  "resources": "normal"
}
```

### 3. End-to-End Pipeline Test
Create `scripts/pipeline-test.sh`:
- Send test audio through full pipeline
- Verify transcript generation
- Confirm LLM response
- Validate TTS audio output
- Measure end-to-end latency

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# Send test phrase: "Hello there, can you tell me the story of Socrates?"
# Verify each stage completes successfully
# Report latency metrics
```

### 4. Docker Health Checks
Add to docker-compose.yml:
```yaml
services:
  orchestrator:
    healthcheck:
      test: ["CMD", "curl", "-f", "http://localhost:8000/health"]
      interval: 30s
      timeout: 10s
      retries: 3
      start_period: 40s
```

### 5. Configuration Schema Validation
Validate on startup:
- Required vs optional configs
- Type checking (URLs, ports, booleans)
- Default value fallbacks
- Clear error messages for missing configs

```python
# Example validation:
class ConfigValidator:
    required_fields = ["WHISPER_URL", "OLLAMA_URL", "TTS_URL"]
    def validate(self):
        # Check all required fields exist
        # Validate URL formats
        # Test connectivity
```

### 6. Service Dependency Checks
Each service validates its dependencies on startup:
- STT service → WhisperLive connectivity
- Conversation service → Ollama availability  
- TTS service → Kokoro accessibility
- Frontend → Orchestrator WebSocket

## Longer Term Improvements

### 7. Monitoring Dashboard
- Real-time service status
- Pipeline latency metrics
- Error rates and patterns
- Audio processing statistics
- WebSocket connection health

### 8. Automated Testing Pipeline
- Run E2E tests on every commit
- Test configuration changes
- Validate Docker compose files
- Check environment variable usage
- Integration tests for each service

### 9. Error Handling & Resilience
- Circuit breakers for external services
- Retry logic with exponential backoff
- Graceful degradation modes
- Better error propagation to frontend
- WebSocket reconnection logic

## Implementation Priority

**Phase 1 (Immediate - This Week)**:
1. Enhanced startup validation script
2. Comprehensive health check endpoints
3. E2E pipeline test script

**Phase 2 (Quick Wins - Next Week)**:
4. Docker health checks
5. Configuration schema validation
6. Service dependency checks

**Phase 3 (Long Term - Next Month)**:
7. Monitoring dashboard
8. Automated testing pipeline
9. Error handling & resilience improvements

## Success Metrics

- **Zero environment-related startup failures**
- **< 30 second detection of service failures**
- **< 5 minute recovery from common issues**
- **100% pipeline test success rate**
- **Visible transcript processing in logs/UI**

## Common Issues Addressed

This strategy directly addresses:
- Missing environment variables
- WebSocket connection failures
- Service dependency startup issues
- Missing imports/configuration errors
- Audio pipeline breaks with no visibility
- Transcript processing verification
- Service communication timeouts

## Notes

- Focus on immediate actions first as they provide the highest impact
- All scripts should be executable and well-documented
- Health checks should be fast (< 5 seconds) to avoid blocking
- Error messages should be actionable and specific
